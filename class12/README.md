## Announcements

1. Feedback from Dr. Love on all Project A Plans should be posted to Canvas **by class time**. Those of you who need to do a third version need to get that in by Saturday at 9 AM (that's 9 in the morning, not evening.)
    - The status report remains [at this link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2023/blob/main/projectA/plans.md).
    - In case I missed it anywhere, if you have a binary variable in your work that is coded 1 = Yes and 2 = No, you need to change that to 1 = Yes and 0 = No (or to a factor with values Yes and No) in section 3 of the project.
2. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 11 should be posted **by class time**.
3. Quiz 1 materials will be available **by 5 PM today**. 
    - Quiz 1 is due on Monday 2023-02-27 at 9 PM. All of your responses must be on the Google Form by that time.
    - Read the instructions carefully before starting the Quiz.
    - To ask questions about the Quiz, either post them as questions (to the instructors and TAs only) on Campuswire, or email `431-help at case dot edu`. TAs will not answer questions about the Quiz during their office hours this weekend.

[Chapter 18 in the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/) covers the topic of building a Table 1 far more extensively, with two detailed examples. Those notes should be helpful for doing the Table 1 work required in [Lab 5](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/lab5.html).
