## Announcements / Updates since last class

1. I updated [the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus-2023/) to point to [Contact Us](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/contact.html) as the place containing our Campuswire information.

3. I updated the Course Grading Roster on our Shared Drive to include feedback and grades on [Lab 3](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/lab3.html).
4. I updated [the Quiz 1 page](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/quiz1.html) to include a link to a [PDF of the (draft) instructions for Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2023/blob/main/quiz1/instructions_only_draft.pdf).

    - We want to be sure all Project A Plans are approved well before 2023-03-01 at noon.

## On (Project) Titles

- Your project should have a meaningful title (not containing the words “432” or “Project” or “Proposal” or “Plan”) but rather something describing your actual data and plans.
- Please keep the main title to no more than 80 characters, including spaces.
- Avoid deadwood like "The Analysis of" or "Analyzing" or "Effects of" or "factors associated with" in titles.
- Don't use acronyms, initialisms or abbreviations in titles which confuse the reader. 

Your readers for assignments in 432 include: other students in this class, the TAs, and Dr. Love.

## One Last Thing

[Labeling the x and y axes: Here’s a quick example where a bit of care can make a big difference](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/01/26/labeling-the-x-and-y-axes-heres-a-quick-example-where-a-bit-of-care-can-make-a-big-difference/) by Andrew Gelman

- The post is made in reference to [this article at Namerology from Laura Wattenberg](https://namerology.com/2020/08/20/the-three-ages-of-i-names-an-american-tale/) and the graph shown below, and is meant to show that even a generally good graph (like this one) can be improved with some attention to details.
