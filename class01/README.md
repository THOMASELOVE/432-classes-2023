## Today's Agenda

- Course Mechanics
    - 
- Why I Write Dates the Way I Do
    - 
- Data Organization in Spreadsheets
    - 
- Naming Things and Getting Organized
    - 
- Switching from R Markdown to Quarto
    1. I've gathered resources for helping with this transition [on our Sources page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2023/tree/main/sources#learning-about-quarto-and-making-the-switch-from-r-markdown).
    2. Virtually any code you have written in R Markdown can be run using Quarto instead, by simply switching the file extension from .Rmd to .qmd.
    3. It's still worth it to learn about how Quarto works, and why it differs from R Markdown when it does.
- Building and Validating Linear Prediction Models
