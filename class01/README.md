- Why I Write Dates the Way I Do
    - 
- Data Organization in Spreadsheets
    - 
- Naming Things and Getting Organized
    - 
- Switching from R Markdown to Quarto
    - I've gathered resources for helping with this transition [on our Sources page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2023/tree/main/sources#learning-about-quarto-and-making-the-switch-from-r-markdown).
    - Virtually any code you have written in R Markdown can be run using Quarto instead, by simply switching the file extension from .Rmd to .qmd.
    - It's still worth it to learn about how Quarto works, and why it differs from R Markdown when it does.
- Building and Validating Linear Prediction Models
    -

## What Should I Be Working On?

By Wednesday 2023-01-18 at Noon:

1. Get officially registered (SIS) for the right flavor of the course (PQHS 432, CRSP 432 or MPHP 432) if you're not already.
2. Welcome to 432 survey at https://bit.ly/432-2023-welcome-survey complete by noon tomorrow.
3. Accept your invitation to Campuswire (see your email or [visit here](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/contact.html#once-class-starts)) and then answer my little poll question there, please.

Before our next class Thursday 2023-01-19 at 1 PM

1. Review the [website](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/) and [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/calendar.html), and skim the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus-2023/) and [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/).
