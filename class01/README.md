- Switching from R Markdown to Quarto
    - I've gathered resources for helping with this transition [on our Sources page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2023/tree/main/sources#learning-about-quarto-and-making-the-switch-from-r-markdown).
    - Virtually any code you have written in R Markdown can be run using Quarto instead, by simply switching the file extension from .Rmd to .qmd.
    - It's still worth it to learn about how Quarto works, and why it differs from R Markdown when it does.
- Building and Validating Linear Prediction Models
    - See the [431 Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/), as well as the [432 Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/). Both will remain online until 2023-06-01.

## What Should I Be Working On?

By Wednesday 2023-01-18 at Noon:

1. Get officially registered (SIS) for the right flavor of the course (PQHS 432, CRSP 432 or MPHP 432) if you're not already.
2. Welcome to 432 survey at https://bit.ly/432-2023-welcome-survey complete by noon tomorrow.
3. Accept your invitation to Campuswire (see your email or [visit here](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/contact.html#once-class-starts)) and then answer my little poll question there, please.

Before our next class Thursday 2023-01-19 at 1 PM

1. Review the [website](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/) and [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/calendar.html), and skim the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus-2023/) and [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/).
2. Buy Jeff Leek's How to be a Modern Scientist (then read this by the end of January - it should take ~ 4 hours.)
3. Get started installing or updating your R and RStudio and install these R Packages and data/code from 432-Data.
4. Get started on Lab 1, which is due Monday 2023-01-23 at 9 PM.
