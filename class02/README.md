- The PDF link provides the version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Quarto file link provides the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides.
- See [the resources page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2023/tree/main/sources#learning-about-quarto-and-making-the-switch-from-r-markdown) for more advice on using Quarto and transitioning to Quarto from R Markdown. 

## Announcements
 
1. TA Office Hours begin Friday afternoon. A complete schedule, with Zoom links, is available on our Shared Google Drive, on Canvas, and on Campuswire. 
2. I've added Chapters 12 and 13 to the Course Notes since our last class. The references may look a little weird - those will get fixed when I've finished posting the main chapters. My current guess is that there will be 26 chapters in total, so in that sense, you have half the notes now.

## Welcome to 432 Survey

Thanks to all of you for completing the survey on time. Here's a [summary of my feedback (PDF)](432-welcome-survey-results.pdf).

## One Last Thing

![](snowtilesTwitter.png)

[Origin and development of a Snowflake Map](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/snow-tiles-demo/) by Althea Archer (posted 2023-01-11) provides reproducible R code demonstrating the evolution of a recent data visualization of snow cover in the continental United States. This work is a product of the USGS (United States Geological Survey) - the nation's largest water, earth and biological science and civilian mapping agency.

I learned about this work from [this post at FlowingData](https://flowingdata.com/2023/01/17/snow-cover-mapped-using-snowflakes/).

## Shameless Promotion: The Play That Goes Wrong 

- The Play That Goes Wrong runs from January 27 - February 18, 2023 on Friday and Saturday nights at 8 PM at [Aurora Community Theatre](https://www.auroracommunitytheatre.com/).
- Details at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater and https://www.auroracommunitytheatre.com/
- Thank you.
