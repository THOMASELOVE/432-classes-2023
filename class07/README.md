## Today's Announcements

1. Feedback on Lab 2 is now available in the Lab 2 tab on the Grading Roster in our Shared Drive.
2. The Lab 3 Answer Sketch will be posted to our Shared Drive **by class time**.
3. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 7](https://bit.ly/432-2023-minute-07), due Wednesday at noon.
4. I made small edits (also listed in [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) responses) in an effort to help with instructions for Lab 3 and Project A.
5. I updated the [slides for Class 06](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2023/tree/main/class06) to indicate a willingness to spend a total of 16 degrees of freedom.
6. I also updated Chapter 13 in the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/) to clean up the phrasing in one spot.
7. Thank you to those of you who've contributed to the conversation about "How To Be A Modern Scientist" on [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) so far. The current question will remain active until 2023-02-17. Please weigh in, if you haven't yet done so.
8. I slightly updated the instructions to [Lab 4](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/lab4.html) (due 2023-02-20) to add a hint about the number of rows in the data you'll be working with in Questions 2-5.

## What should I be working on?

1. [Minute Paper after Class 7](https://bit.ly/432-2023-minute-07) due tomorrow (Wednesday 2023-02-08) at noon.
2. [Project A Plan](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/projA.html) due Monday 2023-02-13 at 9 PM.

## Project A Plan

To help you understand what we'll be doing with your Project A Plan once we receive it, I've prepared this [PDF of our Evaluation Plan for the 432 Project A Plans](projAplan_evaluation.pdf) that the TAs and I will use. Please look at it, so you can ensure that you meet the standards we'll be checking **before** you submit the work.

Steps to complete the Project A Plan are laid out in [the Project A instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/projA.html), but here's a brief summary...

1. Read the [Project A instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/projA.html) and our [Evaluation Plan for the Project A Plans](projAplan_evaluation.pdf)
2. Decide whether you are working alone or with a partner
3. Identify a data set that [meets the requirements laid out in the instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/projA.html#what-makes-a-data-set-acceptable)
4. Open a new project in R, and [use the Quarto template we provided](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data/master/templates/projectAplan_template.qmd) for the Project A plan
5. [Load your data](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/projA.html#loading-and-tidying-the-data) into R
6. [Clean your data](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/projA.html#loading-and-tidying-the-data), obtaining a [tidy tibble](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/projA.html#the-tidy-tibble) of the information you actually need
7. [Build a codebook](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/projA.html#the-code-book) for your data
8. Identify an outcome and set of predictors for your [planned linear regression modeling](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/projA.html#linear-regression-plans)
9. Identify an outcome and set of predictors for your [planned logistic regression modeling](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/projA.html#logistic-regression-plans)
10. Complete the remaining elements of the 1 unnumbered and 10 numbered sections of the Project A plan, following [the template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data/master/templates/projectAplan_template.qmd)
11. Spell-check your work by hitting F7 in RStudio, and then knit the final version to HTML, and check that HTML document to be sure it looks right, and to be sure that you've covered [everything we'll be looking for in our evaluation](projAplan_evaluation.pdf) of your work, then
12. Submit your finished work (qmd, html and Rds file) to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) by **Monday 2023-02-13 at 9 PM**.

Note that you can [run a data set past us](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/projA.html#running-a-data-set-past-us-for-project-a) if you're unsure whether it will work, but you'll want to do that no later than noon Friday, as Dr. Love will be away from his computer most of the weekend.


## The Play That Goes Wrong

A few tickets are still available for our last four performances: February 10, 11, 17 and 18 at 8 PM, at https://www.auroracommunitytheatre.com/. If you cannot get a seat in the Center, then House Left (seats begin with the number 1, rather than 3) is probably a better choice than House Right.
