3. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 7](https://bit.ly/432-2023-minute-07), due Wednesday at noon.
4. I made small edits (also listed in [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) responses) in an effort to help with instructions for Lab 3 and Project A.
5. I updated the [slides for Class 06](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2023/tree/main/class06) to indicate a willingness to spend a total of 16 degrees of freedom.
6. Thank you to those of you who've contributed to the conversation about "How To Be A Modern Scientist" on [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) so far. The current question will remain active until 2023-02-17. Please weigh in, if you haven't yet done so.

## What should I be working on?

1. [Minute Paper after Class 7](https://bit.ly/432-2023-minute-07) due tomorrow (Wednesday 2023-02-08) at noon.
2. [Project A Plan](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/projA.html) due Monday 2023-02-13 at 9 PM.

## Steps to complete the Project A Plan

are laid out in [the Project A instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/projA.html), but here's a brief summary...

1. Read the Project A instructions
2. Decide whether you are working alone or with a partner
3. Identify a data set that meets the requirements
4. Open a new project in R, and use the Quarto template we provided for the Project A plan
5. Load your data into R
6. Clean your data, obtaining a tidy tibble of the information you actually need
7. Build a codebook for your data
8. Identify an outcome and set of predictors for your planned linear regression modeling work
9. Identify an outcome and set of predictors for your planned logistic regression modeling work
10. Complete the remaining elements of the 1 unnumbered and 10 numbered sections of the Project A plan, following the template
11. Spell-check your work by hitting F7 in RStudio, and then knit the final version to HTML, and check that document, as well
12. Submit your finished work (qmd, html and Rds file) to Canvas by Monday 2023-02-13 at 9 PM.

Note that you can [run a data set past us](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/projA.html#running-a-data-set-past-us-for-project-a) if you're unsure whether it will work, but you'll want to do that no later than noon Friday, as Dr. Love will be away from his computer most of the weekend.

## The Play That Goes Wrong

A few tickets are still available for our last four performances: February 10, 11, 17 and 18 at 8 PM, at https://www.auroracommunitytheatre.com/. If you cannot get a seat in the Center, then House Left (seats begin with the number 1, rather than 3) is probably a better choice than House Right.
