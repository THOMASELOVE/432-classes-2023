## Today's Announcements

1. I made small edits (also listed in Campuswire responses) in an effort to help with instructions for Lab 3 and Project A.
2. I updated the slides for Class 06 to indicate a willingness to spend a total of 16 degrees of freedom.
3. Thank you to those of you who've contributed to the conversation about "How To Be A Modern Scientist" on Campuswire so far. The current question will remain active until 2023-02-17. Please weigh in.
4. Feedback on Lab 2 is now available in the Lab 2 tab on the Grading Roster in our Shared Drive.
5. The Lab 3 Answer Sketch will be posted to our Shared Drive **by class time**.
6. There is a Minute Paper after Class 5, due Wednesday at noon, which will be available **by class time**.

## What should I be working on?

1. Minute Paper after Class 5 due tomorrow (Wednesday 2023-02-08) at noon.
2. Project A Plan due Monday 2023-02-13 at 9 PM.

## The Play That Goes Wrong

A few tickets are still available for our last four performances: February 10, 11, 17 and 18 at 8 PM, at https://www.auroracommunitytheatre.com/. If you cannot get a seat in the Center, then House Left (seats begin with the number 1, rather than 3) is probably a better choice than House Right.
