## Announcements
 
1. I reposted the [Slides for Class 05](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2023/tree/main/class05#todays-slides), fixing the typo identified in slide 20 during class, but also including new screenshots that more clearly use the `helpdat` data.
2. Minute Paper after Class 05 feedback **will be available by class time**.

## One Last Thing

From the weekly [Data is Plural newsletter](https://www.data-is-plural.com/)

**Women’s well-being.** [Camille Belmin et al.'s](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01824-2) [LivWell dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/7277104) presents “a set of key indicators on women’s socio-economic status, health and well-being, access to basic services and demographic outcomes” in 447 regions of 52 countries from 1990 to 2019. The indicators include, for example, rates of home ownership, educational attainment, and domestic violence; they’re based primarily on [data](https://dhsprogram.com/data/) from the [Demographic and Health Surveys Program](https://dhsprogram.com/), a [USAID-funded initiative](https://dhsprogram.com/Who-We-Are/About-Us.cfm) that, since 1984, “has provided technical assistance to more than 400 surveys in over 90 countries, advancing global understanding of health and population trends in developing countries.” Read more: [An introductory Twitter thread from Belmin](https://twitter.com/BelminCamille/status/1597948618220384256).
