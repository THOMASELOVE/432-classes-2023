- The PDF link provides the version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Quarto file link provides the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides.
- See [the resources page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2023/tree/main/sources#learning-about-quarto-and-making-the-switch-from-r-markdown) for more advice on using Quarto and transitioning to Quarto from R Markdown. 

## Announcements
 
1. I updated Lab 3's instructions and Chapter 10 in the Course Notes to fix typos, and the instructions in Labs 1-8 to clarify the late policy.
2. **Campuswire** 
    - If someone provides a response or question on Campuswire that is useful to you, please acknowledge that by clicking the little up arrow next to the post. That's much more useful to us (because of the way the forum shows posts) than saying thanks in a comment.
    - Some people had more than one account on Campuswire. I have tried to fix that now. Let me know if you have problems.
3. Last night (2023-01-30) you should have received an email from me with the subject line: **432 Lab Code from Professor Love (please save this email)**. That email provides the three-digit Lab Code you will need to identify the feedback and grades for your work on the **Grading Roster for 432 Spring 2023** found on our *Shared Google Drive*. Here you will find detailed feedback and grades for all Labs (so far, just Lab 1, of course), and the grades for your Minute Papers (so far, just the Minute Paper after Class 03).
    - Note that the mark for your Lab is (probably) listed as 1 out of 50 on Canvas. Ignore that. The marks on Canvas just tell us we graded your Lab, and has nothing to do with your grade on the Lab. No course grades appear on Canvas; instead we post them to the Shared Drive in the **Grading Roster for 432 Spring 2023**.
    - Should you want me to regrade your Lab, follow [the policy described here in the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus-2023/08-grading.html#lab-appeal-policy---request-a-review-via-google-form), which involves filling out the form at <https://bit.ly/432-2023-lab-regrades> by noon on 2023-05-09. Thanks.
4. Professor Love added six examples of (edited) student work on Question 1 visualizations to the Lab 1 Answer Sketch on our Shared Google Drive. Please review that material for several good ideas that you should be able to apply in future work.
5. The Lab 2 Answer Sketch has also been posted to our Shared Google Drive.
6. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 05](https://bit.ly/432-2023-minute-05) due Wednesday 2023-02-01 at Noon.

## Learning More About the Harrell-Verse

In classes 05-06, we'll start to focus on a set of techniques from the `rms` and `Hmisc` packages for fitting and evaluating linear regression models developed by Frank Harrell at Vanderbilt, with his colleagues. As supplemental reading, I can strongly recommend:

- [An Introduction to the Harrell"verse": Predictive Modeling using the Hmisc and rms Packages](https://www.nicholas-ollberding.com/post/an-introduction-to-the-harrell-verse-predictive-modeling-using-the-hmisc-and-rms-packages/) by Nicholas Ollberding
- Frank Harrell's [Biostatistics for Biomedical Research (BBR) Course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-o_ZZ0tuFUYn8e8rf-QURA/videos) includes a series of lectures on many of the topics we'll be discussing in 432, in addition to several late-breaking items. Details on the course are available [here](https://hbiostat.org/bbr/) and the notes are linked below.
- Frank E. Harrell and Chris Slaughter [Biostatistics for Biomedical Research Notes](http://hbiostat.org/doc/bbr.pdf) (pdf) - also see the YouTube course above.
- Frank E. Harrell [Regression Modeling Strategies](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2023/blob/main/sources/pdf/Harrell_Regression_Modeling_Strategies_2015_2e_protected.pdf), 2nd Edition, 2015.
- [datamethods](https://discourse.datamethods.org/) "is a place where statisticians, epidemiologists, informaticists, machine learning practitioners, and other research methodologists communicate with themselves and with clinical, translational, and health services researchers to discuss issues related to data: research methods, quantitative methods, study design, measurement, statistical analysis, interpretation of data and statistical results, clinical trials, journal articles, statistical graphics, causal inference, medical decision making, and more." This resource's [rationale is here](http://fharrell.com/post/disc), and Frank spends meaningful time responding to questions on that board, so when our course ends, you might consider looking there for some suggestions.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Minute Paper after Class 05](https://bit.ly/432-2023-minute-05) due Wednesday 2023-02-01 at Noon.
2. We expect you to have finished reading "How To Be A Modern Scientist" by class time Thursday 2023-02-02.
3. [Lab 3](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/lab3.html) is due Monday 2023-02-06 at 9 PM to Canvas.
4. Your [Project A Plan](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/projA.html) is due Monday 2023-02-13 at 9 PM to Canvas.

## How's the Show Going?

Really, really well. The crowds this past weekend could not possibly have been more enthusiastic. Please come, if you'd like, but get your tickets very soon. We are approaching a sellout for most performances. "The Play That Goes Wrong" continues its run on Friday and Saturday evenings at 8 PM through 2023-02-18. Tickets can be purchased at https://www.auroracommunitytheatre.com/, and the theatre is about 40 minutes from CWRU by car.
