## The Play That Goes Wrong

A few tickets are still available for our last four performances: February 10, 11, 17 and 18 at 8 PM, at https://www.auroracommunitytheatre.com/. If you cannot get a seat in the Center, then House Left (seats begin with the number 1, rather than 3) is probably a better choice than House Right.
