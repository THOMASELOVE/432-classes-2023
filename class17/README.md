## Announcements

1. There are now 27 classes scheduled rather than 28.
    - This necessitated slight changes to [the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus-2023/) (some typos, fixing the count of Minute Papers), the [Minute Paper page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-minute-2023), and [the Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/calendar.html). 
    - Our class originally scheduled for Thursday 2023-04-20 will instead be an (optional) "Ask Dr. Love Anything" session, conducted via Zoom (using the same PQHS/CRSP/MPHP 432 Class Zoom link as usual.) This change is to give you a bit more time (just under a full week) with Quiz 2, and to give you the chance to ask me questions at a time when I expect you'll have some.
2. I made a small adjustment to [Lab 7](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/lab7.html), in terms of how it will be graded, but this shouldn't affect your response at all. I also fixed some unclear parts in one of the questions in [Lab 8](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/lab8.html) and shortened that assignment, so be sure to use those links to get the most up-to-date versions.
3. Our next class (Class 18 on Thursday 2023-03-23) is also unusual in that it will be held **via Zoom only**, because our regular classroom is unavailable. 

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. There is a Minute Paper after Class 17 due at noon Wednesday 2023-03-22. It will be posted **by class time**.
2. If you haven't yet responded to the "How To Be A Modern Scientist (Discussion 2)" Prompt on Campuswire, you have until tomorrow (2023-03-22) at 5 PM to do so for credit.
3. [Lab 6](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/lab6.html) is due Monday 2023-03-27 at 9 PM. This Lab uses ideas from Classes 14-16.
4. Your [Project B Proposal Form](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/projB.html) is due Monday 2023-04-10 at 9 PM.
