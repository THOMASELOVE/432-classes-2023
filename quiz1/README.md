# Quiz 1 Materials for 432 in Spring 2023

Quiz 1 is due **Monday 2023-02-27 at 9 PM**. Here are the materials you need:

1. (**Available Now**) The [main document (pdf) for Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2023/blob/main/quiz1/432_quiz1_2023.pdf), which includes both instructions and all of the questions. 
    - I corrected a typographical error in Question 14 (page 17) at 9:30 AM on Saturday 2023-02-25. The problem was with the specification of Model A in the demonstration just before the question is asked. It's fixed in the version available now, dated 2023-02-25.
    - Several students have written to suggest that they can come up with multiple ways to obtain the correct area under the ROC curve after fitting a model using multiple imputation in Question 26. I don't think that's true. I think that if you want to use multiple imputation with the model `modC2`, there is just one way to obtain an area under the ROC curve after that fit.

2. (**Available Now**) Here is the [link to the Google Form Answer Sheet for Quiz 1](https://forms.gle/e4VKeWGYA3Ga9m2X7), where you will submit your responses. The URL is <https://forms.gle/e4VKeWGYA3Ga9m2X7>. You must log into Google using your CWRU ID to access the form.
