## A Few Recent Papers That Explain Or Use This Week's Methods

I've built a **new** page as part of our [Sources materials](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2023/tree/main/sources), called ["A Few Full-Text Open Source Papers (since 2018) that Explain or Use 432 Methods"](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2023/blob/main/sources/recent.md).

Here's the list from that page for Regression on Count Outcomes...

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. Project A Portfolio - be sure to complete all of the necessary tasks and submit everything by Monday 2023-03-20 at 9 PM.
2. We've pinned a prompt about "How To Be A Modern Scientist (Discussion 2)" to Campuswire, and will again award class participation credit to people who respond by 2023-03-22 at noon.
3. A reminder that bonus [Lab X](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2023/labX.html) now exists. Please take a look.

## One Last Thing

- [The new scientific review on masks and Covid isn’t what you think](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/2/22/23609499/masks-covid-coronavirus-cochrane-review-pandemic-science-studies-infection) by Kelsey Piper at Vox.
- [Do physical measures such as hand-washing or wearing masks stop or slow down the spread of respiratory viruses?](https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses) is the Cochrane review referred to here.
