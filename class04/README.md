## From [On the 12th Day of Christmas, a Statistician Sent to Me...](https://www.bmj.com/content/379/bmj-2022-072883)

> To elicit the most common issues encountered during statistical peer review, an internal survey was administered to The BMJâ€™s statistical editors. Twelve items were identified, and each are described here. There is one item for each of the 12 days of Christmas, the period between 25 December and 5 January when the statisticians conduct their reviews in the mindset of the Grinch, but with the kind heart of *Miracle On 34th Street*.
